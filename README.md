ThreatScan Notify is a browser-based tool that analyzes uploaded audio files to detect threatening or sensitive speech.
It uses Whisper to convert speech to text, spaCy to detect key phrases, and a BERT-based sentiment model to assess emotional tone. 
If both a sensitive keyword and strong sentiment are found, the system automatically sends an alert email to authorities. Designed for clean audio, it ensures fast, accurate, and context-aware threat detection.
